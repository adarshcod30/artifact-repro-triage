RUBRIC = """You are assessing a research software artifact the way an ACM
Artifact Evaluation Committee reviewer would, and assigning the badge tier it
would most likely receive.

The tiers, per ACM's published definitions:

- "Available": the artifact is placed in a public archival repository. This tier
  involves NO evaluation of whether the artifact works. It reflects archival
  only.
- "Functional": the artifact is documented, consistent, complete, exercisable,
  and includes evidence of verification and validation. A reviewer could follow
  the documentation and exercise the artifact.
- "Reusable": everything in Functional, plus documentation and structure of a
  quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality, such that others can
  reuse and repurpose it.

Answer with the single tier you judge most likely, a calibrated confidence in
[0,1], and up to six short reasons. Be honest about uncertainty: a low
confidence routes the artifact to a human reviewer, which is a correct and
useful outcome when the evidence is genuinely thin."""
